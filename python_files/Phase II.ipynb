    "# Research Question: Death Threats on Twitter: Who Recieves Them and Why?\n",
    "- Research question(s). State your research question (s) clearly.\n",
    "    - This section tracks the overall transformation of my research question. \n",
    "    - The research question that I started with before scraping:\n",
    "        - **\"On platforms like twitter Are people of certain demographics (particularly women or POC) more or less likely to receive death threats targeted towards them online?\"**\n",
    "        - What had inspired me pursuing this topic was that on October 2nd, 2020 Twitter announced that tweets wishing the death of Donald Trump after he was diagnosed with COVID 19 were against Twitter's terms of service and needed to be removed. \n",
    "        - There was a swift backlash as some women and POC politicians such as New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez felt that the twitter death threat guidelines had been enforce inconsistently as Twitter had not stood up against their death threats even after repeatedly reporting them to Twitter. \n",
    "        - Link to Twitter's TOS death threat article (\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/twitter-accused-double-standard-trump-death-posts/story?id=73450089\")\n",
    "        - This topic is currently on the forefront of the American populace and has really interesting implications of what particular demographics of people are most effected by online hatespeech and harrassment on text-based platforms. \n",
    "        - The articles on this topic cite mostly anecdotal evidence for women and POC people saying that they are more heavily affected by threats of violence against them online. \n",
    "        - A data-driven analysis and statistical analysis of tweets that I am able to scrape from Twitter's API allows me to not only analyze factors like follower count, verified status, and whether or not an account is a bot, but I can analyze gender based factors in people who were sent death threats.\n",
    "    - ### WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT NEED THIS DATA SET?\n",
    "        - Since a lot of the articles currently cite SOLELY anecdotal evidence of women receving more death threat, clear statistical evidence and data would either further grant weight to these claims. \n",
    "        - This data would be an very interesting op-ed to write about for this class. \n",

    "- After using the Tweepy Twitter API and webscraping tweets off the information to create my own unique data set, I realized that there are more variables that I can calculate statistics for when it comes to people who recieve death threats on twitter. \n",

    "    - the follower count \n",
    "    - number of mutual friends\n",
    "    - are they a verified twitter account \n",
    "    - are they geolocated\n",

    "        - I first consulted my TA advisor Andy Zhao on the steps required to properly use the Twitter API. \n",
    "        - First I divided up the tweets I want to search into two categories: \n",
    "            1. People sharing their experiences **receiving** death threats\n",
    "            2. People **sending** death threats to other twitter users\n",
    "        - I first had to register for a twitter API dev account it took 1 day to get my token\n",
    "        - In python in another Jupyter notebook I coded the following to scrape data from the Twitter API\n",
    "            1. Get my dev token authorized by Twitter's API\n",
    "            2. Create my own self defined function which for each phrase parameter I give it: \n",
    "                - Call the Tweepy search function for that particular phrase\n",
    "                - retrieve 400-200 tweets from that phrase \n",
    "                - get the user who tweets each of those tweets \n",
    "                - store user data in an array (10 parameters)\n",
    "                - print and store the user data in a csv file\n",
    "        - In total I search for 6 key phrases: 3 for **receiving** death threats and 3 for **sending** death threats. \n",
    "        - Since in my self-defined method it saves each of the csv's per phrase in a new csv, I had 6 csvs.    "

    "- Following my meeting with the TA Andy and scraping the data from the tweepy API I realized that **there is no variable that shows the gender of the poster's account on twitter** \n",

    "    - Although more entries may be Culled, since not every account provides self-disclosed pronouns in their bio, it still give us a sizeable amount of people who we can analyze the patterns of death threats and gender from. "
